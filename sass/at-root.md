# @at-root

The `@at-root` rule is usually written `@at-root <selector> { ... }` and causes everything within it to be emitted at the root of the document instead of using the normal nesting. It's most often used when doing [advanced nesting](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector#advanced-nesting) with the [SassScript parent selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector#in-sassscript) and [selector functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/selector).
